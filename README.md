ðŸ“… Proposed project solution for the Databases course @ FEUP

## Project description

Vaccination presents itself as one of the most important problems in modern society. This project aims to represent a vaccination campaign database.

It is composed of a vaccines table that stores their name, producer, the diseases that it prevents, the number of inoculations, the interval between inoculations, and the temperature range at which they should be stored. Vaccines are initially stored in a main storage center, from which they can be transported to other storage centers, or delivered to vaccination centers. The number of doses stored and transported is maintained throughout. People are later called to take the vaccine according to their group, which is defined by their address, job, pathologies, and/or age. The vaccination center assigned to a person is automatically calculated given their job and address.
