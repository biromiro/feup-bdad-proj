## Vaccination Monitoring Program

Vaccination presents itself as one of the most critical problems in modern society. This project aims to represent a vaccination campaign database.

Vaccines are defined by their name, producer, the disease it prevents, the number of inoculations needed and the temperature range at which they must be reserved. Vaccines are initially hoarded in the main distribution center, from which they can be transported to other storehouses, or delivered to vaccination centers. The number of doses stocked and transported is maintained throughout. People are called to receive the vaccine according to their group, which is defined by their address, job, pathologies, and/or age. The vaccination center assigned to a person is automatically calculated given their job and address.
